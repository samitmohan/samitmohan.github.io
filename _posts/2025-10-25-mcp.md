MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are like web APIs—but built for LLM interactions. With them, language models like Claude or ChatGPT can do things, not just talk about them.

I’m always listening to music and creating playlists on Spotify, and I use LLMs daily in my browser. But until now, there was no easy way to control Spotify using an LLM.

That’s where MCP Servers come in.

#### Why LLMs Don’t Recognize Spotify Natively

#### How It Works

![How it Works](https://i.ibb.co/VWb2BcTj/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1-42-10-PM.png)

#### What I Wanted to Do

- Play, pause, and skip tracks via Claude
- Queue songs by name or mood
- Get quick info about the music
- Make playlist according to 'vibes' 
- Ability to manipulate music and my current playlists on Spotify

### Model

Under the hood, I used the Spotipy Web API plus the MCP integration for Claude. After setting up Spotify credentials and installing the right dependencies, here is a sample of server.py file:-

```python
# server.py
import mcp.server.fastmcp
from spotipy import Spotify
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

auth = SpotifyOAuth(
    client_id="id",
    client_secret="secret",
    redirect_uri="uri",
    scope="user-modify-playback-state user-read-playback-state user-read-currently-playing",
    cache_path=".cache",
    open_browser=True
)

# caches the access token to avoid repeatedly requesting permission from Spotify
token_info = auth.get_access_token(as_dict=False)
sp = Spotify(auth_manager=auth)

# Create an MCP server
server = mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP("Demo")

# Spotify tools
@server.tool()
def play_music():
    # code for playing music

@server.tool()
def pause_music():
    # code for pause

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run(transport='stdio')
```

You also need to integrate this into Claude (Desktop Local App) via the claude_desktop_config.json file -:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "spotify": {
          "command": "/Users/smol/.local/bin/uv",
          "args": [
              "--directory",
              "/Users/smol/fun/mcp-server/mcp-server-demo",
              "run",
              "server.py"
          ]
      }
  }
}
```

Then

```python
mcp run server.py
```

**Now Claude can use your Spotify tools!**

Spotify unfortunately is lame. No use of localhost or support for custom HTTPS + removes all fun features like analysing audio. They did this last week, guess I’m late to the AI learning hype. But MCP servers are growing quickly—see other examples at the [official repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) 

Had to use ngrok for tunneling which seems excessive [localhost](http://localhost) server, other than that the python stuff is pretty basic and mcp does the magic. 

I am surprised by how fast I was able to build this, probably because of the spotipy api but even without that, it won’t take that much time.

Example of not using spotipy-:

```python
# Raw API sample (if not using Spotipy)
def play_song(access_token, track_uri):
    url = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/play"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    data = {"uris": [track_uri]}
    return requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=data).status_code
```

Or you could use flask-:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/play', methods=['POST'])
def mcp_play():
    data = request.json
    status = play_song(data['token'], data['uri'])
    return jsonify({"status": status})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=5000)

```

LLMs have been mostly observers, not doers.

Would be pretty cool if everyone can control their 3rd party apps via LLMs. Creating a trading account bot which talks to LLM or flight booking APIs so I don't have to open MMT or Zerodha everytime I've to purchase a ticket/stock should be easy now. I can just tell Claude to do it for me.
