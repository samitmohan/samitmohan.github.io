was in a big rut — middle of nowhere in my life.
watched ted lasso — it was really good.
so good, it shifted something. brought my focus back to allowing myself be happy.

booked tickets to bombay. didn't tell anyone, no plan. i don't like to post photos but i also want to put my memories out somewhere... and i forget all the cute details of every trip i’ve ever been on, so this time i wanted to write about it!!

## highlights ##

- **day1:** flight ~ most gorgeous looking ppl i’ve ever seen, i am gurgaon’s #1 prospect, yet a strong 4/10 on that flight. although sitting behind me were 3 men from gurgaon talking about oceanic swimming, alcohol and how “situation hi aadmi ko banata hai”... decided not to visit or repeat any place / order for the entire trip and only get unique shit. ordered mcdonald's.
- **day2:** [ncpa](https://www.instagram.com/ncpamumbai/?hl=en) art gallery (they host multiple art galleries all over the city first thursday of every month) followed by [americano](https://www.americanobombay.com/) -> crab mac n cheese & deadly rabbit cocktail 10/10 + the famous [carter blues](https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/carters-blue-1-carter-road-bandra-west) shawarma, marine drive + saw mumbai indians team bus & some fans screaming “boom boom bumrah” runnin behind it. also had ashok vada pav but my nothing beats my mother's.
- **day3:** old street bar, [veronicas](https://veronicasbombay.com/) (12/10), toto's (pecos bangalore  / helter skelter delhi but worse), watched chak de india with friends to prepare them for their [nike after dark marathon](https://afterdarktour.nike.com/en/home)
- **day4:**  breakfast at [pizza by the bay](https://pizzabythebay.in/) (caught the waiter sleeping at the front desk but he was too sweet, mid place though 3/10) day drank sake and martini. evening @ bonobo [crab culture](https://www.instagram.com/crabculturee/) & negronis.
- **day5:** [nandan coffee](https://www.nandancoffee.com/visit-us/) -> too bougie for my bihari ass. had a separate menu for dogs (₹400 for sourdough bread & eggs for some dumbass dog) but the greatest coffee i’ve ever had -> raspberry latte, [gustoso](http://gustoso.co.in/) pizza (great but nothing delhi doesn’t have)
- **day6:** went to see relatives in navi mumbai (it is a real place unfortunately) with no ticket in the local -> played football with random bombay boys & won (delhi game different shoutout FCBEscola academy sector 50 gurgaon) also had [miya kebab](https://www.instagram.com/miyakebabs/?hl=en) ~ insane kashmiri chicken kebab
- **day7:** breakfast @ the oldest parsi restaurant [kyani & co](https://www.theislamicheritage.com/detail/Mumbai-s-Popular-Kyani-Co-Bakery) -> dinner @ [bombay daak](https://elledecor.in/bombay-daak-new-bar-in-mumbai/). the hype is real. had rabbit for the first time, felt like i was in the bear opening night episode.

felt rejuvenated, 2025 was horrible until this. realized it doesn’t have to be great or horrible all the time. whatever goes up eventually comes down & then goes up again. gotta play the cards i'm dealt with.  as for why this blog ? cuz this mah hobby & i'm a hobbyist by profession or whatever [brent faiyaz](https://www.instagram.com/brentfaiyaz/p/DJcZqwyyneA/?hl=en) said.
