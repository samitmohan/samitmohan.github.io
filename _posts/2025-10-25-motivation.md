what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you working on one of them? put deep work into that.
deep work on simple, basic ideas helps to build true virtuosity.
lesser time you spend on your phone better your day goes. don’t spend time making lists. don’t restrict yourself with rules. just focus. be earnest, more you study more confident you feel.
there are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. but if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray. never sell out.

you just gotta say fuck all this & work on things that actually make you happy. more empty time in your mind, worse it is. always be occupied. find things to do other than just WORK work, that is your break, this way entering flow state will be much easier since you are always doing something. focus on your fun.

force yourself to do it the correct way. no matter what ~ *im going to do the thing i’m going to do and i’m going to do it well, maybe it takes me a lot longer and that’s okay, that’s not the point of it.* resilience is key in pursuit of excellence. curiosity + bias for action is a must.

give back to parents, they’re selfless and they’ve given up their life for you. never be disrespectful and always find a way to show them love. be a good son, be a better brother. go out with them. especially with maa. sit more with papa. call didi more.
