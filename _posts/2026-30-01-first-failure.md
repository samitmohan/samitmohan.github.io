My only resolution for 2026 was to solve one machine learning problem a day.

Made it 20+ days. Went to bombay for concert and lost my streak...

Still solved **100+ problems** though.

## Why I'm Done

DeepML is solid, but:

- Test cases suck
- Runtime is painfully slow
- The "1 problem/day" pressure was killing the fun

## New Resolution

Chill the f out:

- **Papers → Implementation** 
- **TensorTonic** for practice — better platform, built by someone I know.
- **CUDA** Reading CUDA for Deep Learning one chapter / week — because GPUs rock

All my from-scratch implementations live here: [DeepML Solutions](https://github.com/samitmohan/ML/tree/master/DeepML)
