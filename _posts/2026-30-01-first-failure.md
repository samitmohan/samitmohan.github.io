## The Resolution

Solve 1 DeepML problem every single day. No excuses.

Made it 20+ days. Went to bombay for concert and lost my streak...

Still solved **100+ problems** though. Not bad for a "failure."

## Why I'm Done

DeepML is solid, but:
- Test cases are hit or miss
- Runtime is painfully slow
- The "1 problem/day" pressure was killing the fun

## What's Next

Dropping the rigid streak mentality. New approach:
- **Papers → Implementation** 
- **TensorTonic** for practice — better platform, built by someone I know.
- **CUDA** Reading CUDA for Deep Learning one chapter / week — because GPUs go brrrr

## The Code

All my from-scratch implementations live here: [DeepML Solutions](https://github.com/samitmohan/ML/tree/master/DeepML)

First public failure of 2026. I tried. Learnt a ton. Moving on.
